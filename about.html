            <li style="font-size: large;">The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu Pandemic, was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza, A virus.</li>
            <li style="font-size: large;">This world-wide epidemic caused by influenza viruses led to between 50 and 100 million deaths in 1918 and 1919 (as much as 1 of every 18 people).</li>
            <li style="font-size: large;">More people died from the 1918-1920 Spanish Influenza Pandemic than there were casualties as a result of the First World War.</li>
            <li style="font-size: large;">Many researchers have suggested that the conditions of the war significantly aided the spread of the disease.</li>
